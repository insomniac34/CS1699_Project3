Source Code File Names:
testwords.txt -> ORIGINALLY called "words.txt", this is the same as Dr. Ramirez's words.txt
init.php -> initialization script for the database
Hangman.php -> gets the random word from the database and sends it via JSON to the client
SupportPortalLogger.php -> my logger object for debugging
app.js -> all of my javascript, 90% of it is AngularJS
index.html -> main html page 
modalContent.html -> an HTML template for the popup window
page-hangman.html -> angular HTML template for the game itself
page-highscore.html-> originally for viewing high scores, BUT NEVER GOT TO THIS
page-home.html -> contains the HTML for the main menu
style.css -> main customized CSS code

Additional Comments:
It works with no errors to the best of my knowledge.
I build a fancy tree menu, but ran out of time to implement everything except the "start a new game" option. IT's OK though, because I used this project as practice for building a fancy AngularJS menu system, and I indeed accomplished that goal.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Go to the main menu, under "game" go to "start new game". 

MIGHT NEED TO CHANGE PERMISSIONS OF FOLDER, under linux I set it to: chmod -R 777 v3/
